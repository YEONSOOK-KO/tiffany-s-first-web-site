    <p>If you welcome someone, you greet them in a friendly way when they arrive somewhere. Welcome is also a noun. There would be a fantastic welcome awaiting him back here. You use welcome in expressions such as welcome home, welcome to London, and welcome back when you are greeting someone who has just arrived somewhere.</p>
